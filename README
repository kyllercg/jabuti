What is Jabuti?
---------------

Jabuti is a system to make the synthesis of Asynchronous Communication
Mechanisms.

In a more precisely way, Jabuti is a program that takes as input a description
of a system composed by a number of process and communication channels and
makes the composition of all process in order to obtain a uniq process that
preserves the properties of the policy that should be implemented by the
communication channels.

Ahhhh, Jararaca is the name used in Brasil for a king of turtle very common in
the in the Amazon region.

Requirements
------------

Jabuti was developed under the following environment. At the present time I do
not know what is necessary to make it to run in other systems.

	* Linux version 2.4.19
	* g++ version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)
	* bison (GNU Bison) 1.875a
	* lex version 2.5.4
	* autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59
	* automake (GNU Automake) 1.8.4

How to compile it
-----------------

After downloading the source code, it is necessary to execute the commands
below to compile Jabuti.

	$ tar zxvf jabuti.tar.gz
	$ cd jabuti
	$ ./configure
	$ make

In the above commands, it is required to substitute the string "jabuti" by
"jabuti-<version>", where "<version>" stands for the version number of the
jabuti that you have downloaded. For example jabuti-0.3.1.

How to execute it?
------------------

Once you have compiled jabuti, you will find the executable file in the
directory:

	<jabuti_dir>/src/acms/

So, to run jabuti will should execute something like:

	src/acms/jabuti <input_file>

and jabuti will generates its result in the standard output of the system.

If you want you can also copy the jabuti executable to some other directory or
even try "make install" (I did not test it).
